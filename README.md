# cpp-class-creator
This is a tool that initializes a class in c++. It will create a c++ header and implementation file with getters and setters for each data field you input.
The UI can be a little nasty at times but do your best to keep up with it. Additionally, the name of your header will be <class name>Gen. This is to distinguish a generated class from a non generated class.
